# Todo Project With React
This project is a todo list application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

The main component, TodoWrapper, handles the overall functionality of the application. It includes a title, a form for adding new tasks, and a list for displaying existing tasks. The state is managed using the todos array.

The TodoForm component is responsible for adding new tasks. When the user fills out the form and clicks the "Add Task" button, the addTodo function is called to add the new task to the todos array.

The Todo component represents an individual task. Each task can be marked as completed, edited, or deleted. These actions are triggered by the toggleComplete, editTodo, and deleteTodo functions, respectively.

The EditTodoForm component is used for editing a task. By clicking on a task, the user can enter edit mode. In edit mode, the text of the task can be modified, and changes can be saved.

The TodoWrapperLocalStorage component is an enhanced version that utilizes local storage to persist tasks. This ensures that the tasks are retained even after the page is refreshed or closed. The tasks are stored in the local storage, allowing the user to access their todo list across sessions.

The project utilizes icons from the FontAwesome library to enhance the user interface.

Overall, this project provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing a todo list.








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
